            <p>Iâ€™m Levi, I was born July 10, 2011, I like all Tech well besides Godot but everything else is amazing. I will be going on a trip to the British Isles in June and will be spending about 14 HOURS on the plane. But then it's about a 2 week stay and will be having so much fun. I spent many hours building my own games that still are in development and hopefully will be coming out soon! My favorite class was creative coding but it is now Explore tech.</p>
